
## Chain of responsibility

Intent : "Avoid coupling the sender of a request to its receiver by giving than one object a change to handle the request. Chain the receiving objects and pass the request a long the chain"

## Command 

Intent : "Encapsulate a request as an object, thereby letting you parameterize with different requests, queue or log requests, and support undoable operations." 

## Iterator

Intent : "Provide a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation."

## Observer

Intent : "Define a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically."

## Strategy

Intent: "Define a family or algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make then interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it."
